ðŸŽ® **BUILD BOARDBREAKER GAME - EXPERT LEVEL PROMPT**

I need you to create "Boardbreaker" - a sophisticated web-based board game. Build it as a complete, bug-free HTML file with embedded CSS/JavaScript.

**CORE GAME:**
- 7Ã—7 snaking board game (squares 1â†’49)
- 8 persona combinations affect board generation (Tactician/Daredevil + Lucky/Persistent + Sprinter/Jumper)
- Complex square types: Safe, Animation, Movement Modifiers, Battles, Random Events, Persona-specific
- Win: Reach square 49. Lose: Trigger persona-specific death (e.g., Sprinter overshoots 3x, Daredevil hits 3 traps in row)
- Scoring: Completion time + mini-game wins + "strength score"

**TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Clean modular architecture (GameEngine, BoardGenerator, PersonaSystem, SquareSystem, AnimationEngine)
- Robust state management with proper error handling
- 8 different board generation algorithms based on persona traits
- Smooth animations (60fps) with intuitive UI
- Local storage for leaderboards and saves
- Mobile-responsive design

**IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:**
1. Core board system with persona-based generation
2. Dice rolling, movement, and basic square resolution
3. All square types with their specific behaviors
4. Mini-games: Tap Race, Quick Aim, Memory Match, Dodge Drop
5. Debuff system (Slow Roll, Slippery Grip, Fogged Vision, etc.)
6. Animation polish and scoring system

**CODE QUALITY:**
- Professional game architecture that's easily extensible
- Handle all edge cases and validate board generation
- Consistent naming, proper commenting, clean structure
- Performance-optimized with smooth user experience

**DELIVERABLE:** Single HTML file with complete playable game, beautiful UI, all features working, ready to deploy.

Start with the core architecture and board generation - that's the most complex part. Build systematically and test thoroughly. Make it awesome! ðŸš€
